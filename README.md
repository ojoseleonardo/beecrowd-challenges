> *Select One Of The Following Problems:*


|Name| Description | #|
|--- |--- | ---|
|[Extremely Basic](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/extremelyBasic)|*Read 2 variables, named A and B and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable X. Print X as shown below. Print endline after the result otherwise you will get “Presentation Error”.*| `1001`|
|[Area of a Circle](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/areaOfACircle)|*The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = π . R2. Considering to this problem that π = 3.14159: Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description.*|`1002`|
|[Simple Sum](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleSum)|*Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable SOMA. Write the value of this variable.*|`1003`|
|[Simple Product](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleProduct)|*Read two integer values. After this, calculate the product between them and store the result in a variable named PROD. Print the result like the example below. Do not forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”.*|`1004`|
|[Average 1](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/average)|*Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point.*|`1005`|
|[Average 2](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/average)|*Read three values (variables A, B and C), which are the three student's grades. Then, calculate the average, considering that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and the grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.*|`1006`|
|[Difference](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/difference)|*Read four integer values named A, B, C and D. Calculate and print the difference of product A and B by the product of C and D (A * B - C * D).*|`1007`|
|[Salary](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/salary)|*Write a program that reads an employee's number, his/her worked hours number in a month and the amount he received per hour. Print the employee's number and salary that he/she will receive at end of the month, with two decimal places.*|`1008`|
|[Salary with Bonus](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/salaryWithBonus)|*Make a program that reads a seller's name, his/her fixed salary and the sale's total made by himself/herself in the month (in money). Considering that this seller receives 15% over all products sold, write the final salary (total) of this seller at the end of the month , with two decimal places.*|`1009`|
|[Simple Calculate](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleCalculate)|*In this problem, the task is to read a code of a product 1, the number of units of product 1, the price for one unit of product 1, the code of a product 2, the number of units of product 2 and the price for one unit of product 2. After this, calculate and show the amount to be paid.*|`1010`|
|[Sphere](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/sphere)|*Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.*|`1011`|
|[Area](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/area)|*Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show: a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C. b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159) c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height. d) the area of the square that has side B. e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.*|`1012`|
