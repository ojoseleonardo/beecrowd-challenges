|[Simple Sum](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleSum)|*Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable SOMA. Write the value of this variable.*|`1003`|
|[Simple Product](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleProduct)|*Read two integer values. After this, calculate the product between them and store the result in a variable named PROD. Print the result like the example below.*|`1004`|
|[Average 1](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/average)|*Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point.*|`1005`|
|[Average 2](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/average)|*Read three values (variables A, B and C), which are the three student's grades. Then, calculate the average, considering that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and the grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.*|`1006`|
|[Difference](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/difference)|*Read four integer values named A, B, C and D. Calculate and print the difference of product A and B by the product of C and D (A * B - C * D).*|`1007`|
|[Salary](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/salary)|*Write a program that reads an employee's number, his/her worked hours number in a month and the amount he received per hour. Print the employee's number and salary that he/she will receive at end of the month, with two decimal places.*|`1008`|
|[Salary with Bonus](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/salaryWithBonus)|*Make a program that reads a seller's name, his/her fixed salary and the sale's total made by himself/herself in the month (in money). Considering that this seller receives 15% over all products sold, write the final salary (total) of this seller at the end of the month , with two decimal places.*|`1009`|
|[Simple Calculate](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/simpleCalculate)|*In this problem, the task is to read a code of a product 1, the number of units of product 1, the price for one unit of product 1, the code of a product 2, the number of units of product 2 and the price for one unit of product 2. After this, calculate and show the amount to be paid.*|`1010`|
|[Sphere](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/sphere)|*Make a program that calculates and shows the volume of a sphere being provided the value of its radius (R) . The formula to calculate the volume is: (4/3) * pi * R3. Consider (assign) for pi the value 3.14159.*|`1011`|
|[Area](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/area)|*Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show: a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C. b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159) c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height. d) the area of the square that has side B. e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.*|`1012`|
|[The Greatest](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/theGreatest)|*Make a program that reads 3 integer values and present the greatest one followed by the message "eh o maior". Use the following formula:* [here!](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/assets/72801979/771798f8-7142-4e8f-8993-e5368ee4b02f)|`1013`|
|[Consumption](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/consumption)|*Calculate a car's average consumption being provided the total distance traveled (in Km) and the spent fuel total (in liters).*|`1014`|
|[Distance Between Two Points](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/tree/1-BEGINNER/distanceBetweenTwoPoints)|*Read the four values corresponding to the x and y axes of two points in the plane, p1 (x1, y1) and p2 (x2, y2) and calculate the distance between them, showing four decimal places after the comma, according to the formula: Distance =* [here!](https://github.com/ojoseleonardo/beecrowd-java/assets/72801979/f1b8f71c-24e3-4539-85b4-b0a495c6f7e2)|`1014`|
